Welcome! I am a fourth-year PhD student at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu) advised by [Prof. Jingbo Shang](https://shangjingbo1226.github.io/). 
I spent wonderful time doing research at [Google Cloud AI](https://research.google/teams/cloud-ai/), [Google Research](https://research.google/), [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/), and [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/).
I received my B.S. in Computer Science from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) in 2020, where I was advised by [Prof. Xiaojun Wan](https://wanxiaojun.github.io/).

My research focuses on applying NLP to real-world problems. I am particularly interested in building systems that can process and understand a wide range of data, including tabular data, visually-rich documents, web contents, etc, aiming to bridge the gap between vast knowledge sources and practical NLP applications.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
