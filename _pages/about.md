Welcome! I am a fourth-year PhD student at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu) advised by [Prof. Jingbo Shang](https://shangjingbo1226.github.io/).
I spent wonderful time doing research at [Google Cloud AI](https://research.google/teams/cloud-ai/), [Google Research](https://research.google/), [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/), and [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/).
I received my B.S. in Computer Science from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) in 2020, where I was advised by [Prof. Xiaojun Wan](https://wanxiaojun.github.io/).

My research focuses on language model reasoning. I particularly interested in (1) reducing hallucination and enhancing factuality with retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and long-context understanding; (2) empowering the reasoning ability of LLMs with multiple data resources for various practical scenarios, including tabular data for table-based reasoning, programming language for code generation/understanding, web pages for web mining, etc.
