Welcome! I am a fourth-year PhD student at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu) advised by [Prof. Jingbo Shang](https://shangjingbo1226.github.io/).
I spent wonderful time doing research at [Google Cloud AI](https://research.google/teams/cloud-ai/), [Google Research](https://research.google/), [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/), and [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/).
I received my B.S. in Computer Science from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) in 2020, where I was advised by [Prof. Xiaojun Wan](https://wanxiaojun.github.io/).

My research centers on leveraging language models for reasoning and planning, with a focus on: **(1) LLM + Retrieval:** Enhancing factual accuracy and minimizing hallucinations through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). **(2) LLM + Code:** Improving the automatic debugging capabilities and coding proficiency of language models. **(3) LLM + Multimodal:** Empowering language models to tackle multimodal tasks via autonomous agents, such as table-based reasoning and visually-rich document extraction.
