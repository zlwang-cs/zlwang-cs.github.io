Welcome! I am a fifth-year PhD student at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu) advised by [Prof. Jingbo Shang](https://shangjingbo1226.github.io/).
I spent wonderful time doing research at [Amazon Foundation Model](https://www.amazon.science/), [Google Cloud AI](https://research.google/teams/cloud-ai/), [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/), [Google Research](https://research.google/), [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/), and [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/).
I received my B.S. in Computer Science from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) in 2020, where I was advised by [Prof. Xiaojun Wan](https://wanxiaojun.github.io/).

My research spans several areas of natural language processing, including reasoning, information extraction, multimodal learning, and language modeling. I primarily focus on LLM post-training, targeting at aligning LLMs to complex reasoning and planning with knowledge-intensive queries, autonomous agents, and mathematical problem-solving. Currently, I am exploring the collaboration of weak and strong LLMs and the process supervision with Monte Carlo Tree Search.

My earlier research forcused on visually-rich document understanding, where I enabled language models to encode multimodal features and understand the rich contents in documents of various formats, such as forms, receipts, web pages, etc.
